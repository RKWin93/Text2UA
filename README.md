## Introduction 
We deals with automatically constructing an OPC UA information model (IM) aimed at enhancing data interoperability among heterogeneous system components within manufacturing automation systems. Empowered by the large language model (LLM), we propose a novel multi-agent collaborative framework to streamline the endto-end OPC UA IM modeling process. Each agent is equipped with meticulously engineered prompt templates, augmenting their capacity to execute specific tasks. We conduct modeling experiments using real textual data to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, improving modeling efficiency and reducing the labor workload.

- *End-to-end efficient OPC UA information modeling method*
- *Compatible with multiple data sources*
- *Do not rely on a predefined reference data model*

## Motivation（Easy Build for OPC UA Information Modeling）
<img src="./Assets/motivation.png" width="800" alt="Motivation">

Data sources are divided into structured data (STD) and unstructured data (NSTD), utilized for describing device properties, production resource status, task requirements, etc. Modeling occurs in two scenarios:
1) **Known system components:** these components are currently in use and have generated data (e.g., STD: sheets or tables) representing their key properties or the system’s requirements. These data are represented through various structured pairs composed of text and their corresponding values (TVPs). In such cases, the IM can be directly modeled based on these TVPs.
2) **Unknown system components** (e.g., newly accessed devices): these components have not yet been put into use and require a survey or understanding of their properties or functions based on technical documents or specifications (i.e., NSTD). In this scenario, we need to extract useful information from relevant texts and create a reference template for OPC UA IM. 

**Existing Limitation:**
1) Manually identifying and summarizing the information needed for modeling from data sources is a labor-intensive modeling method with low efficiency.
2) Mapping rule-based modeling methods require a reference data model established through prior manual efforts and are difficult to adapt to dynamic changes.

### Industrial dataset
Both STD generated by automation components in production processes and NSTD collected from the technical documents or websites of automation components are utilized for modeling. The textual STD includes 2 sensors, 2 actuators, 2 controllers, and 2 connectivity components with a total of 113 TVPs from [11]. The textual NSTD includes 4 robot arms, like ABB (A.), KUKA(K.), FANUC (F.), and YASKAWA (Y.), for discrete manufacturing and 4 typical chemical equipment, like Reactor (R.), Boiler (B.), Extractor (E.), and Distillator (D.), for process manufacturing.


## Main results

## How to Run
### Generate the dataset 
Generate the dataset below:
Take xxxxx for example

Structure of xxx Folder:
```
xxx/
│
├── xxx
│   
└── ...
```

```bash
cd xxxx
python xxxx.py
```

### Run E2E-MAPPO
* Quick start 
```bash
xxxxxx
```
  
* Train your own model
```bash
xxxxxxxx
```
